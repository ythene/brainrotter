[[devlogs]]

Okay! here we go. I just wanted a place to keep all the silly little thoughts I had to myself. I should get the GitHub working to be safe lol. Gonna try and get in the habit of documenting something before I attempt it, so I can see the line of reasoning. More effort, but could be useful for a full-stack whatever.

- Do name
	- `git config --global user.name "Ythene`
	- it worked! :3

Tell git about GH email:
- `git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"`

Let's do a silly little example push so the devlog syncs.
