[[devlogs]]

Okay! here we go. I just wanted a place to keep all the silly little thoughts I had to myself. I should get the GitHub working to be safe lol. Gonna try and get in the habit of documenting something before I attempt it, so I can see the line of reasoning. More effort, but could be useful for a full-stack whatever.

- Do name
	- `git config --global user.name "Ythene`
	- it worked! :3

Tell git about GH email:
- `git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"`

Let's do a silly little example push so the devlog syncs. 
1. `git add obsidian-vault/`
2. `git commit -m "blah"`
3. `git push origin main`

Okay that didn't work because they've disabled password authentication. Need a personal access token. Using [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) for such purposes. 

Okay, went through all that. Push again?
